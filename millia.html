                <h1>Moveset</h1>
                <h2>Normals</h2>
                <h3>5P</h3>
                <img src="images/millia-guide/millia-5p.png" class="millia-5P">
                <p>Millia's standing punch, also known as "5P", is one of Millia's
                    faster grounded moves. That being said, it's still not as fast you expect. 5P is 7 frames on
                    startup, which compared to other character's normals like Chipp's 5P (3 frames startup), is pretty slow.
                    It's still a pretty good "get off me" tool if you think 6P will be too slow for any incoming approach
                    from the air. However, keep in mind that 2P and 2K are faster on startup (5 frames), so those may be better
                    to get your opponent off if they are grounded and close. It can combo into itself, 2P, 6P, 6K, 6H so if you land a 5P, feel
                    free to use any of those other normal moves to extend your damage. Personally, I recommend 
                    6H into a combo ender if you are able to catch them in the air with your 5P.
                </p>
                <h3>5K</h3>
                <img src="images/millia-guide/millia-5k.png" class="millia-5K">
                <p>Millia's standing kick, also known as "5K" will be one of your most used normal moves with a 7 frame startup.
                    Because of how Millia stretches out her leg, the move goes pretty far and will be one of Millia's best long 
                    range moves. 5K can combo into itself, 6P, 5K, 2K, 6K, 6H, 5D, 2D. The most important out of those gattling options
                    will be 5K, 2K, and 2D as they will all lead to her primary win condition. To maximize her damage here, I would recommend
                    to combo as many 5Ks as you can (which will usually be 1-3 depending on the distance), into 2K and 2D, then finally her heavy disc,
                    into whatever mix you want.
                </p>
                <h3>5H</h3>
                <img src="images/millia-guide/millia-5h.png" class="millia-5h">
                <p>Millia's standing heavy slash, also known as "5H" is one of Millia's more damaging normals. Its startup is around
                    12 frames and reaches pretty far. That being said, 5H will be one of the moves that Millia will probably use
                    sparringly. Most of the moves that 5H can combo from can also be comboed from 2H which will lead to more meterless
                    and damaging combos. An advatnage that 5H has over 2H is that it covers a lot more distance horizontally. For example, if 
                    Millia lands a f.S, it can be comboed into 5H into Iron Savior.
                </p>
                <h3>5D</h3>
                <img src="images/millia-guide/millia-5d.png" class="millia-5d">
                <p>Millia's standing dust, also known as "5D" is Millia's most damaging normal when charged. Like every dust,
                    there is a uncharged and charged version. Uncharged's startup is 20 frames while charged's startup is 28 frames.
                    Unfortunately, there will rarely be a chance to use this normal in neutral. The orange indicator as well as how noticable
                    Millia's 5D is, it is easily reactable and you will rarely get a charged dust off. If you do catch your opponent lacking
                    and they're only blocking low, then feel free to add it to your bag of mixes.
                    Its uncharged version also does not combo into anything reliable so its uses in neutral is very limited. 
                    Charged 5D however will be one of your better wallbreaks if you have enough time and do not want to commit meter into an overdrive.
                </p>
                <h3>2P</h3>
                <img src="images/millia-guide/millia-2p.png" class="millia-2p">
                <p>Millia's crouching punch, also known as "2P" is Millia's fastest normal with a startup of 5 frames. 2P is one of Millia's 
                    best "get off me" tool if your opponent has any gaps in their grounded combos. It can combo into itself, 5P, 6P, 6K, and 6H.
                    However, you probably will not be using 2P too often in neutral as it can rarely lead to any meaningful combos.
                    However, 2P can lead to some great OTG mixups that we can discuss later and stuff any incoming moves. From my personal experience,
                    2P is a pretty good answer to some moves, for example I-no's Stroke the Big Tree. 2P can also be used to YRC bait as its recovery frames 
                    are the fastest of her normals at 10 frames.
                </p>
                <h3>2K</h3>
                <img src="images/millia-guide/millia-2k.png" class="millia-2K">
                <p>Millia's crouching kick, also known as "2K" is Millia's second fastest normal with a startup of 6 frames. Similar to 2P, 2K 
                    can be a great start-up move due to being one of Millia's faster normal. 2K however, is monumentally better than 2P in terms of
                    how useful it is. It can combo 6P, 6K, 6H, 5D, and 2D. The ability to combo 2D after 2K is the biggest reason why Millias use 
                    2K instead of 2P in neutral. In addition to its combo potential, it also has a lot more range that 2P which is why more 2K is a lot
                    more popular to use than 2P despite its slower startup. Similar to 2P, it can also be used in OTG Mixups. It can also be used in 
                    Mirazh corner loops as 2K is a great move to extend the combo as it is able to bounce the enemy around with the wall in the corner.
                </p>
                <h3>2S</h3>
                <img src="images/millia-guide/millia-2s.png" class="millia-2S">
                <p>Millia's crouching slash, also known as "2S" is Millia's go-to low normal to go for after her c.S. It has a startup of 11 frames so while it's not too fast,
                    it's also not one of her slower normals. It covers okay distance horizontally while also hitting low so it could be used in neutral. It can combo
                    into 5H and 2H. Both of these routes will lead to decent damaging combo enders so despite only have two routes, what is extended off of them
                    is pretty good. 2S has some niche uses, for example after Septum Voices, Millia is able to run up and 2S into 2H into another Septum Voices for big damage.
                </p>
                <h3>2H</h3>
                <img src="images/millia-guide/millia-2h.png" class="millia-2H">
                <p>Millia's crouching heavy slash, also known as "2H" is a starter of one of the routes that Millia can go for as a combo ender. The move has a 14 frame startup so
                    it is not recommended for Millia players to throw this normal out normally in neutral. Typically, Millia players will 2H after a c.S to start their combo ender. The
                    point of going for the 2H route instead of the other routes is that 2H will launch your opponent higher into the air, this will give Millia players more time to set up
                    the disc and be closer for their mixup. However, the disc will not be meaty so keep that in mind. 2H also has the niche of being used in the route where Millia
                    players want to double Septum Voices for big damage as well as being used for some corner combos.
                </p>
                <h3>2D</h3>
                <img src="images/millia-guide/millia-2d.png" class="millia-2D">
                <p>Millia's crouching dust, also known as "2D" is practically Millia's win condition or at least it leads directly to her win condition. It has a startup of 12 frames, so while it's not the fastest normal, players can throw
                    this normal out in neutral to catch the opponent off guard and can be a decent round start. This move will lead to meterless meaty disc which is what Millia players should
                    always strive for. The meaty disc will allow for a 4-way mixup that we will discuss later. Just by having 2D has a gattling option for some of the other normals will
                    instantly make that normal viable to use because 2D is just that good. As a reminder, it can be comboed from c.S, 2K, and 5K and it is highly recommended to eventually go for
                    a 2D during those combo routes if you can.
